  "important_value" : "${{ secrets.important_value }}"
}
```

2. Create a GitHub action secret with a key of: `important_value`

3. Add the following to your workflow configuration file (parameters shown below are for this demonstration only):

```

  filename: test.json
  secret-name: important_value

```

4. During workflow execution, `test.json` (or a file of one's choosing) will be parsed and the reference to a GitHub secret will be replaced with the corresponding secret value.
